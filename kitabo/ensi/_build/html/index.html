<p>We begin in the water. Not with an answer, not with a thesis, but with an amniotic unknowing. The wave, the sea, the nonself: this is <strong>ukuvula</strong>, the great opening. It is not the start of the journey, because there is no journey yet. There is no “you” to travel. There is only motion before motive, reflex before recognition. This is the place of the unformed potential, the limbic prayer of a nervous system before language locks it into a name. In theological terms, it is <em>tohu va’vohu</em>—formless and void. In cosmological metaphor, it is the pre-Big Bang singularity, pulsing with unknowable density. In personal myth, it is the place where our skin has not yet declared itself as boundary. To open is not to begin—it is to be undone. And so <strong>ukuvula</strong> must always carry intra-uterine weight. It is womb-thinking, not yet infected by the illusions of control. It is not metaphor. It is necessity.</p>
<p>From this churning nonself emerges the first directional act—not a step, but a drift: <strong>ukuzula</strong>. The wander. The meander. The ship, iconically rendered as 🚢, becomes the symbol not of mastery, but of inheritance. No one builds their first ship; they wake up inside it. The language of their parents, the synaptic maps of childhood, the scars, the hymns, the legends—these become the planks and sails. One does not choose the ship. One learns to question it while living aboard it. <strong>Ukuzula</strong> is epistemology in motion: the seeking that reveals more about the seeker than the sought. It is the dorsal stream of curiosity, the neural commitment to lateral exploration. To roam is not to be lost—it is to refuse premature conclusions. In this stage, truth is not a destination. It is a direction. Ukuzula respects mystery not as a gap in knowledge, but as a covenant with humility.</p>

<p>And then comes the moment that changes everything: <strong>ukusoma</strong>. Not action, but engagement. Not declaration, but resonance. Here, the symbolic enters the bloodstream—not as narrative, but as tuning fork. The pirate flag and screwdriver—🏴‍☠️🪛—signal rebellion, but not anarchic destruction. They are tools of refinement. Ukusoma is a seduction of signal. One flirts with new frequencies, courts alternate rhythms, tests whether the current ship can carry new cargo. The screwdriver, in its intimacy, disassembles falsehoods without dismantling the whole. The pirate, in their precision, refuses the tyranny of inherited maps. Ukusoma is not war—it is craft. This is the stage of resonance, where values meet perception in medial alignment. Where pattern is no longer enough—meaning is required. In neural terms, the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal regions blaze with integrative fire. In the Ecclesiastic register, this is the time to build and break down. In Ukubona’s theology, this is the time to tune.</p>
<p>But to tune is to risk hearing things you cannot un-hear. To perceive deeply is to suffer. This is <strong>ukubona</strong>: the seeing that wounds. In Luganda and Lusoga, the term <em>okubonabona</em> refers to suffering from seeing too much. It is not a poetic flourish—it is an epistemic diagnosis. To know is to bleed. Ukubona is not simply vision—it is reckoning. The shark, the scissors, the life preserver—🦈✂️🛟—appear here as the tragic triad. The shark tests intention: do you act from fear or from truth? The scissors cut false attachments: not out of cruelty, but from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski#">fidelity to coherence</a>. The life preserver is the grace that keeps what is worth keeping. This is the cingulo-insular matrix in action—the neurology of discernment, empathy, and decision. Ukubona hurts because it must. In mythic language, this is the place where Oedipus blinds himself. Where Cassandra sees but is not believed. Where prophets cry out because they can no longer pretend. In the Ukubonic spiral, this is the crucible. Seeing becomes sacrifice.</p>
<p>Yet from this crucible, something emerges that is not merely survival, but sanctification. This is <strong>ukuvela</strong>—the fifth act, the flourishing that does not erase suffering but builds upon it. Here the island rises—not as utopia, but as testimony. The wreckage of the ship becomes driftwood housing. The tools of resonance become instruments of peace. The cuts are cauterized into covenant. Ukuvela is not the end of the cycle—it is its transformation. The marriage metaphor fits because this is not fusion—it is mutual becoming. Two selves, tempered by prior fire, meet not to complete each other, but to co-create sanctuary. In spiritual language, this is Sabbath. In neural terms, it is the integration of the default mode network with salience and executive function. It is the harmony of memory, meaning, and action. The island is not a rest from journey. It is a fractal beginning. The proof that recursion does not mean repetition—it means sacred pattern.</p>
<p>And then, as all sacred patterns must, the island births the wave. The flourish returns to the opening. Not in regression, but in spiral. Each time we cycle through, we carry the imprint of previous circuits. This is not reincarnation—it is recursivity. The sacred memory of perception. The epistemic spiral that does not climb toward enlightenment, but deepens into it.</p>
<p>Ukubona, then, is not a philosophy. It is not even a theology in the traditional sense. It is a liturgical nervous system. A grammar of survival encoded into symbolic fractals. A way of being that honors the wound, the wander, the tuning, the tearing, and the marriage. It refuses to separate cognition from myth, perception from suffering, language from lineage. It sees too much. And chooses to keep seeing anyway. So let this be scripture: The wave opens. The ship wanders. The pirate tunes. The shark cuts. The island sings. And the water calls again. Ukubona is the response.</p>

<p>Autism has become one of the many symbolic battlegrounds in the cultural and conspiratorial war zones animated by MAGA ideology and the broader far-right populist project. On its surface, this may seem absurd—why would a neurodevelopmental condition become a flashpoint in ideological struggle? But delve deeper and it becomes clear: autism, in the context of right-wing paranoia, is not merely a diagnosis or a medical category; it has been transformed into a mythological figure, a signifier of everything threatening the imagined purity, stability, and hierarchy that movements like MAGA yearn to reimpose on a rapidly evolving world.</p>
<p>This conspiratorial fixation didn’t begin with Donald Trump, of course. It traces back to the late 1990s, when Andrew Wakefield published a now-infamous and thoroughly debunked paper falsely linking the MMR vaccine to autism. Though swiftly discredited and retracted, the lie outpaced the truth with alarming efficiency. In the years that followed, especially with the rise of social media and the collapse of public trust in institutions, this myth metastasized. The anti-vaccine movement gained a foothold across political lines, but it found an especially fertile host in right-wing populism, where distrust of authority, science, and expertise is woven into the ideological DNA. In MAGA circles, vaccines became more than a public health tool—they became an instrument of oppression, symbolic of a broader elite conspiracy to manipulate, weaken, or even reengineer the population.</p>
<p>Autism, then, is often not engaged with as a real condition that affects real people in deeply complex and diverse ways. Instead, it is instrumentalized. It becomes the imagined outcome of some external contamination—whether chemical, moral, or ideological. It becomes a placeholder for anxiety, for grievance, for the unsettling sense that the world no longer makes sense to those who grew up under different myths. The rise in autism diagnoses is not interpreted through the lens of better diagnostic tools, changing social frameworks, or increasing acceptance of neurodivergence. Instead, it is viewed as an “epidemic,” a sudden and inexplicable mutation in the fabric of human development. And because conspiracy theory thrives on affect rather than evidence, this epidemic is understood not as a tragedy to be understood and supported, but as an intentional act—a crime whose perpetrators must be named, vilified, and destroyed.</p>
<p>There is something deeply revealing about the choice to fixate on autism. Unlike more visible or physically marked conditions, autism often reveals itself through behavior—communication differences, sensory sensitivities, alternative ways of socializing or processing the world. In other words, it is a challenge to neurotypical norms, a kind of epistemic friction that exposes the narrowness of mainstream ideas about intelligence, productivity, and emotional expression. For authoritarian and reactionary worldviews—which crave order, predictability, and clean hierarchies—autism becomes not just strange, but threatening. It’s a reminder that the human mind cannot be fully disciplined, that cognition itself is plural and irreducible. In this way, autism is both misunderstood and mythologized. It becomes, perversely, a symbol of cultural collapse—evidence that something has gone terribly wrong with children, families, masculinity, and society itself.</p>
<p>This symbolic role is magnified by the way the far right weaponizes parental anxiety. It is no coincidence that many anti-vaccine and anti-autism conspiracy theorists are parents, often mothers, who feel betrayed by a medical system that they perceive as impersonal and indifferent. Their pain is real—but it is exploited. The emotional grief that can come with having a child whose development doesn’t follow expected trajectories is transmuted, via the alchemy of conspiracy, into righteous fury. That fury is then targeted at convenient villains: doctors, pharmaceutical companies, public health officials, school systems, “woke” educators. Autism is not engaged with on its own terms; it is reduced to a cautionary tale, a horror story meant to justify a war against modernity itself.</p>

<p>Beneath all this, though, lurks something even darker: a return to eugenic logic, cloaked in populist outrage. Autism, in the conspiracy-laden worldview of the reactionary right, is often framed as either a defect to be feared or a sign of manipulation by elites—a deviation from an imagined ideal of neurotypicality, masculinity, or American vigor. This resurrects long-discredited notions of fitness, purity, and control. And it feeds into a broader obsession with the body and mind as sites of ideological struggle—battlefields where either the nation’s strength or its corruption will be made visible. The autistic child is not pitied so much as feared, not supported so much as instrumentalized into a symbol of everything the paranoid mind wants to reject: ambiguity, multiplicity, fluidity, and transformation.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not merely a fringe phenomenon. The vaccine-autism myth has made its way into Senate hearings, talk show circuits, presidential debates. It is fed by influential pundits, amplified by algorithms, and absorbed into a right-wing cosmology that believes it is constantly under siege by external forces—immigrants, feminists, globalists, trans people, climate scientists, and yes, even autistic children. The cruelty here is profound, because it strips autistic people of their agency, their dignity, and their diversity. It turns their lives into rhetorical weapons, all in service of an ideology that cannot tolerate complexity.</p>
<p>Because the real conspiracy is not autism. The real conspiracy is the systematic destruction of empathy in service of power. It is the deliberate sowing of fear and suspicion toward those who move differently through the world. It is the weaponization of grief and the erasure of nuance. In the end, the fight is not between neurotypical and neurodivergent. The fight is between those who need to dominate the world to feel safe, and those who are willing to let the world be wild, plural, and beyond their control.</p>
<p>That’s not a fight we can afford to lose.</p>

<p>Patrick Bet-David is an Iranian-American entrepreneur of Assyrian and Armenian descent. Born in Tehran in 1978 to a Christian family, his father is Assyrian and his mother is Armenian. His family fled Iran during the Iran-Iraq War, spending time in a refugee camp in Germany before settling in the United States when he was ten years old.</p>
<p>Bet-David’s diverse heritage and experiences as a refugee have significantly influenced his worldview. After serving in the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division, he ventured into the financial services industry, eventually founding PHP Agency, a life insurance company, and Valuetainment, a media platform focused on entrepreneurship and personal development.</p>
<p>His background exemplifies the rich tapestry of Iranian-American identities, showcasing how diverse cultural roots can contribute to a multifaceted and successful career.</p>

<p>The Assyrians are a distinct ethnic group with deep historical roots in the ancient Near East. They trace their ancestry back to the Assyrian Empire, a dominant Mesopotamian civilization that thrived between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE, with its capital at Nineveh. In the Bible, the Assyrians are often portrayed as formidable adversaries of Israel and Judah, known for their military prowess and conquests, including the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE.</p>
<p>Today, modern Assyrians are primarily Christian and maintain their unique cultural and linguistic heritage, speaking dialects of Aramaic. They are dispersed globally due to historical persecutions and conflicts. Significant Assyrian populations exist in Iraq (300,000), Syria (400,000), the United States (up to 600,000), Sweden (150,000), and Iran (up to 50,000).</p>
<p>Armenians, another ancient ethnic group, are predominantly found in Armenia, where they constitute over 98% of the population. Large Armenian diaspora communities exist in Russia (up to 2.5 million), the United States (up to 1.5 million), France (500,000–600,000), and Georgia (up to 400,000).</p>
<p>In Iran, Christians make up approximately 2% of the population, with estimates ranging from 250,000 to 370,000 individuals. The majority are ethnic Armenians, followed by Assyrians and Chaldeans.</p>
<p>Regarding the origins of Christianity, both Assyrians and Armenians played pivotal roles. Armenia holds the distinction of being the first nation to adopt Christianity as its state religion around 301 CE. Assyrians, on the other hand, were among the earliest Christian communities, with the Assyrian Church of the East tracing its roots back to the first century CE. Thus, both groups were instrumental in the early spread and establishment of Christianity in the region.</p>
<p><strong>The Disillusioned Rug: On the Illusion of Order and the Necessity of Athenian Filtration</strong></p>
<p>There is a strange alchemy at work in human consciousness, a dance of forms and formlessness, of illusions carefully constructed and then, inevitably, undone. To live is to weave rugs — tapestries of coherence, beauty, and symbolic alignment — and to suffer is to witness their unweaving. “The rug really tied the room together,” says The Dude in <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, grasping, in his half-baked Zen way, at a metaphysical truth. The rug is not merely a floor covering; it is a symbol of illusory coherence, of the Apollonian impulse to arrange chaos into aesthetic form. It is Plato’s form made domestic, Aristotle’s substance dressed in kilim. When that rug is soiled, stolen, or trampled, the disillusionment is not merely domestic or decorative — it is cosmological.</p>
<p>What we call <em>illusion</em> is often the necessary scaffolding of meaning. It is Apollonian in its craving for clarity, form, harmony — the dream of lines and laws and golden ratios. We build temples to it, literally and metaphorically. We model our democracies and our syntax upon its principles. But every Apollonian construction is a wager against the deluge — the Dionysian swell that threatens to undo the careful grammar of our myth. Nietzsche saw this clearly: the Dionysian is not irrationality per se but the saturation of experience beyond rational containment. It is ecstasy, frenzy, fecundity, rot — and it does not argue. It floods. The Apollonian illusion is our only defense against this deluge, but here is the irony: when we refuse to filter the Dionysian through the Athenian — through the discipline of discourse, deliberation, and symbolic restraint — the Apollonian becomes kitsch. It ossifies into dogma or breaks into schizophrenic abstraction. In both cases, the rug is lost.</p>
<p>The Athenian, then, is not merely a mediator between Apollo and Dionysus — it is the crucible through which chaos is sublimated. Athens is not just a place or a polity, but a filtration device, an epistemic sieve. It processes frenzy into drama, passion into rhetoric, raw myth into deliberative mythos. Tragedy itself, that most Greek of genres, is the perfect example of this filtration: the Dionysian ritual is preserved, but structured into cathartic form. The chorus wails, but in metered verse. The hero is undone, but through the laws of narrative necessity. The Athenian mind does not suppress the deluge — it names it, shapes it, renders it visible without dissolving into it. Without this Athenian lens, the Apollonian becomes fragile, brittle, self-deceiving — a sculpture hollow at its core, pretending to permanence.</p>
<p>Disillusionment, then, is not failure — it is revelation. It is not the absence of meaning but the cracking of the container that once held it. It is the recognition that the rug was always provisional, that its coherence was not ontological but aesthetic. Yet here lies the tension: we need the rug. We cannot dwell unmediated in the Dionysian storm — the psyche unfiltered by form is madness. And yet we must not enshrine our rugs as inviolable truths, for when they are inevitably pulled out from under us, we fall not only into confusion, but into nihilism. The trick is to treat illusions as sacred <em>provisionally</em>. To love the rug without believing it will always tie the room together. To trust in Apollo while listening for Dionysus. To build, knowing what we build will fall — and to build anyway.</p>
<p>This is the genius of Athens. Not because it avoided deluge, but because it taught us how to dramatize it. The pre-Socratic world was filled with elemental forces and tribal gods, but Athens gave us the tools to reflect, reframe, and rehearse — to turn frenzy into philosophy, war into politics, chaos into discourse. The modern world, in its frantic embrace of either hard logic or raw emotionalism, often forgets this middle path. We either aestheticize the Apollonian — clinging to cold design, systems theory, algorithmic order — or we dive headlong into Dionysian overflow — psychedelic spirituality, anarchic liberation, meme-maddened semiotic slop. In both cases, the Athenian dimension is lost. No filtration, no discernment. The rug is either bleached sterile or drowned in wine.</p>
<p>What does this mean for our moment? It means that epistemology must be mythic again — but not naïvely so. We must recognize the illusions we live by as structured fictions, necessary rituals of coherence. We must restore the function of the <em>rhetor</em>, the dramatist, the symbol-maker who stands not as mere artist but as priest of pattern. This is not about returning to ancient Athens in form, but in <em>function</em>. To reconstitute the symbolic filtration mechanism that allows the Dionysian to surge without capsizing the ship. The reason we feel mayhem, despair, vertigo in our time is not that we’ve seen through the rug — but that we have lost the means to replace it. Our illusions were cheap, mass-produced, algorithmically reinforced. The disillusionment that followed feels apocalyptic not because it reveals emptiness, but because it reveals our <em>inability to filter</em>.</p>
<p>So let us recover the Athenian act: the liturgy of form that makes sense not by denying chaos, but by rendering it habitable. Let us cherish the rug while holding lightly to it. Let us build rooms not to last forever, but to be beautiful until they fall. And when they fall — as all Apollonian constructs must — let us not weep as though the world has ended, but remember that it is the <em>filter</em>, not the form, that must be preserved. That somewhere in the chorus, the Dionysian laugh still echoes, and it is the Athenian ear that can hear it, shape it, make it sing.</p>
